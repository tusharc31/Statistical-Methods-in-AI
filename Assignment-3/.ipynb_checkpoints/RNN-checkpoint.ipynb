    "For both models the accuracy on negative and positive reviews are similar but majority of the times the accuracy on negative is slghtly lower compared to positive reviews for both LSTM and RNN. This is probably due to the training data.  \n",
    "LSTM mostly performs better than simple RNN. LSTMs remember inputs over a long period of time. This is because LSTMs contain information in a memory. So LSTM can retain the information over the entire review text whereas RNNs do not have such long term memory. Sentiment analysis requires the whole text to be analysed which can be tackled only by LSTM and not RNN. Thus LSTMs have better accuracy."
